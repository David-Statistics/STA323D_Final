## Philadelphia Primary Election Tweets by Candidate
###Data Collection

###Data Analysis

###Output
Our team chose to include a shiny app to showcase the data. Users are able to view a word cloud of the most frequent words tweeted by users about each respective candidate, with the size of the words in the output reflecting word frequency. Additionally, users can view a plot of valence scores (positive/negative sentiment, with 0 being neutral) over time as well as distribution of tweets over time for all candidiates. The code can be found in server.R and ui.R.
